# Stacks and Queues
- A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It means that the item that was most recently added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

 **Imagine a stack of books placed on top of each other. When you add a new book to the stack, it goes on the top, and if you want to remove a book, you start from the top as well. This analogy helps in understanding the concept of a stack.**
  
- A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is similar to a real-life queue or line, where the first person to join the line is the first one to be served. In a queue, elements are added at one end called the "rear" or "tail" and removed from the other end known as the "front" or "head."
  
**Imagine a queue is waiting in line at a ticket counter. When people arrive, they join the queue at the rear, and the person at the front gets served. As each person gets served, they leave the queue from the front, maintaining the order in which they arrived.**
