# AWS: S3 and Lambda

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a cloud-based object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
It is designed for storing and retrieving any amount of data over the internet securely and efficiently.
Some use cases for Amazon S3 include data backup and archiving, website hosting, content distribution, big data analytics, and application data storage.
Benefits of using Amazon S3 include scalability, durability, security, cost-effectiveness, and easy integration with other AWS services.
AWS Lambda:

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by AWS that allows developers to run code without managing servers.
It executes code in response to events from other AWS services, HTTP requests, or custom triggers.
Use cases for AWS Lambda include real-time data processing, automated backups and maintenance, image and video processing, webhook and API integration, and building serverless applications.
In non-technical terms, "serverless" means developers can focus solely on writing code, and AWS Lambda takes care of the server management automatically.
CDN (Content Delivery Network):

A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to deliver web content efficiently.
The main goal of a CDN is to reduce latency and improve website performance by caching and delivering content from servers closer to the website visitors.
When a user visits a website using a CDN, the CDN automatically routes their requests to the nearest server, reducing load times.
Benefits of employing a CDN include improved website performance, scalability, reduced bandwidth costs, enhanced global reach, and improved reliability.
