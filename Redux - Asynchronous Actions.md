**Why use Redux middleware?**
- Redux middleware is used to extend Redux's capabilities, particularly in handling asynchronous operations and side effects in Redux applications. Middleware sits between action dispatch and the reducer, enabling actions to be intercepted and modified before reaching the reducer. My goal is to understand the reasons for using middleware and how it helps manage asynchronous tasks while maintaining Redux's pure and synchronous principles.

**Redux Async Data Flow Diagram:**
- I aim to comprehend the flow depicted in the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. In my own words, I want to describe how asynchronous actions are initiated, intercepted by middleware, processed, and eventually update the application state through reducers.

**Accommodating Async in Redux:**
- I want to understand how asynchronous operations are accommodated in Redux applications, especially through the use of middleware like Redux Thunk. This involves grasping the concepts of action creators returning functions, making asynchronous calls, and dispatching appropriate actions during the process.

**Redux Thunk Middleware:**
- I intend to learn why Redux Thunk middleware is essential in Redux applications. Specifically, I want to understand its role in enabling action creators to return functions instead of plain action objects, and how it simplifies the management of asynchronous logic.

**Return Value from Inner Thunk Function:**
- I aim to gain clarity on how any return value from the inner thunk function is made available or handled in the Redux application. This includes understanding that the primary purpose of the inner thunk function is to dispatch actions that modify the Redux store's state and trigger UI updates in components.

**Reflection:**
- After reviewing the class README and the provided materials, I plan to reflect on how these concepts fit into the broader understanding of Redux and asynchronous actions. I want to ensure that I can apply these principles in practice to build robust Redux applications that handle async operations effectively.

Overall, my goal is to grasp the fundamentals of Redux middleware, Redux Thunk, and the asynchronous flow in Redux applications, and to be able to apply this knowledge to develop more complex and feature-rich Redux-based applications.
