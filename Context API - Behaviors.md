# Context API - Behaviors
useReducer and useContext are two React hooks that work together to simplify state management in React applications. 

- **useReducer** is used for state management. It employs a reducer function to update state based on actions. This is similar to Redux but integrated into React, making it useful for complex state management.

- **useContext** provides access to global state without needing to pass props. It establishes a context for sharing data among components.

When combined, they centralize state logic and eliminate prop drilling, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. This combination is particularly valuable in larger applications where state management complexity can be a challenge.
