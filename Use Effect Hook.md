**1. What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?**

The primary intended use case for the `useEffect` hook is to manage side effects in functional components in React. Side effects can include data fetching from APIs, subscribing to data streams, manually interacting with the DOM, and performing any asynchronous or non-pure operations. Essentially, `useEffect` allows you to perform actions that are not directly related to rendering UI but are essential for the component's behavior.

**2. How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?**

After your component is mounted to the DOM, React runs the effect's setup function provided to `useEffect`. After each subsequent render where the dependencies specified in the dependency array (second argument) have changed, React performs a cleanup by invoking the previous effect's cleanup function (if present), then executes the setup function again with the updated values. When your component is unmounted, the cleanup function is triggered. This mechanism ensures that your side effects are synchronized with the component's lifecycle.

**3. What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?**

The return value from the effect's logic function serves as a cleanup mechanism. It allows you to handle the teardown of any resources or subscriptions that were established during the execution of the effect. By returning a function from the effect, you ensure that when the effect is re-run due to changes in dependencies or when the component is about to be unmounted, the cleanup function is executed. This helps in preventing memory leaks, clearing up resources, and maintaining a clean state as your component's lifecycle evolves.
