# Message Queues

- The Chat Example on the Socket.IO website demonstrates a real-time chat application.
- Users can exchange messages in a chat room instantly.
- The backend server actively listens for connections and responds to events.
- The io.emit() method in Socket.IO allows sending an event to everyone.
- The broadcast flag is used to exclude a certain emitting socket when sending a message to everyone.
- Rooms in Socket.IO enable grouping and targeting specific groups of connected clients.
- Sockets can join and leave rooms to control their participation.
- Namespaces in Socket.IO create separate communication channels with their own events, connected clients, and configuration options.
- Separate namespaces can be used to handle different functionalities or topics independently.
- A possible use case for separate namespaces is in a chat application where each chat room has its own namespace.
