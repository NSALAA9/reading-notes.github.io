# Linked Lists

Introduction:
Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science and programming. They provide a way to store and organize data dynamically.

What are Linked Lists?
A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node holds a piece of data and a reference to the next node in the list. It follows a linear structure, meaning the nodes are arranged in a specific order. Unlike some other data structures, like arrays, linked lists do not require the elements to be stored in contiguous memory locations.

Anatomy of a Linked List:
Node: Each node in a linked list contains two parts:

- Data
- Next pointer
- Head
- Tail

Types of Linked Lists:
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

Linked List Operations:
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Search

Big O notation provides a standardized way to analyze algorithm efficiency by considering input size, units of measurement, orders of growth, and various scenarios. It helps us understand the scalability and performance characteristics of algorithms, including those that operate on linked lists.
