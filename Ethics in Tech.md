# Google and AI
Google has announced that it will not use artificial intelligence (AI) for weapons or surveillance purposes following employee protests over the company's involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon program that utilized AI for analyzing drone footage. The move is part of a set of AI principles aimed at guiding Google's ethical use of AI technology. The principles emphasize the development of AI that is socially beneficial and the avoidance of projects causing overall harm. While this decision was met with mixed reactions from Google employees, it reflects a growing awareness of ethical considerations in AI development and the need for clear guidelines in the tech industry. Some experts argue for more transparency and accountability in ensuring ethical AI practices.
# Ethical dilemma of self driving cars
The development of self-driving cars has raised ethical dilemmas regarding how they should prioritize safety in unavoidable accident situations. Germany has proposed guidelines stating that self-driving cars should minimize human harm without discrimination based on factors like age or gender. However, studies show that passengers often prioritize their own safety, revealing a double standard in how humans perceive machines versus humans. Critics argue that these ethical concerns already exist with current vehicles, such as those with emergency braking systems. Despite these challenges, it's believed that people will become more comfortable with autonomous vehicles over time, as they offer new forms of control and transportation options.
