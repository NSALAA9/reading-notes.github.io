# Event Driven Applications

1. The native Node.js module for Event Driven Programming is EventEmitter. It provides a foundation for implementing event-driven architecture in Node.js applications. With EventEmitter, you can define events and event handlers, allowing different parts of your code to communicate and respond to events.

2. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) complements Event Driven Programming by promoting modularity and encapsulation. In OOP, you can create objects that have their own properties and behavior. These objects can be designed to emit events and handle events triggered by other objects. By using OOP principles, you can organize your code into reusable and maintainable components, making it easier to manage event-driven systems.

3. In the context of Node.js, Event Driven Programming on the backend enables concurrent and asynchronous handling of tasks. Instead of executing tasks sequentially, events can be triggered independently, allowing different parts of the application to respond to events concurrently. This asynchronous nature improves efficiency and flexibility, especially when dealing with complex processes. For example, when planning a surprise party, you can have separate event handlers for tasks like decorating, preparing food, and playing music. By triggering events for each task, you can coordinate these activities concurrently, making the planning process more efficient and adaptable to different scenarios.
