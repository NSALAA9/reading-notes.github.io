**Query String Parameter vs. Path Parameter**:

Query string parameters are added to the end of a URL after a "?" and are used for optional data.
Path parameters are part of the URL path itself and are used for identifying specific resources.
API URL with Path Id Parameter:

Given domain, version, model name, and id information, the API URL with a path id parameter is formed as http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things.
**Dynamic API Interface (Non-Technical Explanation)**:

A dynamic API interface is like a universal remote control for software programs.
It helps different programs communicate and work together, like gadgets controlled by one remote.
The interface provides rules and a common language for programs to understand each other.
**Middleware for Basic and Bearer Auth**:

Middleware is used to implement authentication in server applications.
Basic Authentication checks for username and password in requests.
Bearer Authentication checks for tokens in request headers.
**OAuth Handshake**:

OAuth is a process where users grant permission to apps to access their resources without sharing passwords.
It involves user login, permission request, token issuance, and secure resource access.
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (Non-Technical Explanation)**:

RBAC is like assigning different keys or access cards to people based on their roles.
It ensures people can access only what's relevant to their roles, like rooms in a building.
RBAC keeps data and systems secure and organized.
