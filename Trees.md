# Trees:

Definition: A binary tree is a tree structure where each node can have at most two children, known as the left child and the right child.
Terminology: Nodes, root, leaf, edge, height.
Binary Search Trees (BST):

Definition: A binary search tree is a type of binary tree where nodes are organized in a specific order.
Searching in a BST: Comparison with the current node, moving left or right based on the comparison.
Efficient Searching: Narrowing down the search space.
Traversals:

Depth First Traversal: Pre-order, in-order, and post-order methods.
Breadth First Traversal: Iterating through the tree level-by-level.
Big O Analysis:

Binary Trees: Time complexity of O(n) for insertion and searching in the worst case.
Binary Search Trees: Time complexity of O(h) for insertion and searching, where h is the height of the tree.
